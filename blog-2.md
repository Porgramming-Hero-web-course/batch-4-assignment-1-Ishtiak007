# How to Handle Asynchronous Operations Using `async`/`await` in TypeScript (Over Callback/Promise)

In modern JavaScript and TypeScript development, managing asynchronous operations has always been a key challenge. From traditional callback-based approaches to promises, developers have often struggled with managing complex flows in an efficient, readable manner.

Enter `async`/`await`—a game-changer in handling asynchronous operations. With `async`/`await`, managing async code becomes more natural, leading to cleaner, easier-to-read code.

In this guide, we’ll explore how to handle asynchronous operations using `async`/`await` in TypeScript, and why it’s often preferred over older approaches like callbacks and promises.

## 1. Why `async`/`await`?

Before diving into examples, let's quickly cover **why `async`/`await` is the preferred method** for handling asynchronous operations:

- **Cleaner Syntax**: `async`/`await` enables you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, reducing callback nesting and making the code easier to follow.
- **Error Handling**: With `async`/`await`, you can use `try`/`catch` blocks for handling errors, making your code more structured and predictable.
- **Avoiding Callback Hell**: Callback-based solutions can quickly lead to deeply nested code, often referred to as "callback hell." `async`/`await` flattens this hierarchy.
- **Compatibility with Promises**: `async`/`await` is built on top of promises, meaning that it integrates seamlessly into existing promise-based code.

## 2. The Traditional Callback Approach

Callbacks have long been the go-to solution for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript and TypeScript. However, they can quickly become difficult to manage, especially when multiple asynchronous operations depend on each other.

### Example: Callback-based Async Operation

```typescript
function fetchData(callback: (data: string) => void) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Fetched Data";
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log("Callback received:", data);
});
```
